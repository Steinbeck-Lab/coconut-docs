It provides a comprehensive depiction of chemical structures, encompassing atomic connectivity, tautomeric states, isotopes, stereochemistry, and electronic charge. As a result, it generates a distinctive sequence of machine-readable characters specific to the given molecule.

The InChIKey consists of 25 characters, with the initial 14 characters representing a hash of the connectivity information derived from the complete InChI string. The subsequent 8 characters form a hash of the remaining layers of the InChI. These are followed by a character denoting the version of InChI employed and, lastly, a checksum character. Upon entering an InChIKey, the software retrieves the corresponding specific compound associated with that key.</li></ul><h2 id="molecular-formula" tabindex="-1">Molecular formula <a class="header-anchor" href="#molecular-formula" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Molecular formula&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>The molecular formula reveals the specific atoms and their quantities within a single molecule of a given chemical compound.

As a result, inputting a molecular formula in the search bar will generate a list of compounds that encompass the specified atoms and their respective quantities within each molecule.</li></ul><h2 id="coconut-id" tabindex="-1">COCONUT ID <a class="header-anchor" href="#coconut-id" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;COCONUT ID&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>It is feasible to perform a targeted search on our website, specifically for natural products stored in our database, using their distinct identification numbers.</li></ul>',11),o=[r];function s(c,l,h,u,d,m){return i(),a("div",null,o)}const I=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,I as default};
