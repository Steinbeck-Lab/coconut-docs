# COCONUT online - Simple search 

## Molecule name
* The search engine is capable of recognizing any commonly used Natural Product name entered by the user. These names can be expressed as IUPAC names, trivial names, or synonyms. The search function is specifically designed to capture and identify a comprehensive list of compounds that include the text provided by the user in their search entry.

## InChI-IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI)
* The InChI identifier serves as a widely adopted non-proprietary identifier employed in electronic data sources for the purpose of identifying chemical substances. It provides a comprehensive depiction of chemical structures, encompassing atomic connectivity, tautomeric states, isotopes, stereochemistry, and electronic charge. As a result, it generates a distinctive sequence of machine-readable characters specific to the given molecule. When an InChI is inputted, the search process retrieves a singular compound possessing all the necessary characteristics.

## InChI key
* Chemical compounds can be conveniently searched online using the InChIKey, which is a shortened version of the InChI (International Chemical Identifier). The InChIKey consists of 25 characters, with the initial 14 characters representing a hash of the connectivity information derived from the complete InChI string. The subsequent 8 characters form a hash of the remaining layers of the InChI. These are followed by a character denoting the version of InChI employed and, lastly, a checksum character. Upon entering an InChIKey, the software retrieves the corresponding specific compound associated with that key.

## Molecular formula
* The molecular formula reveals the specific atoms and their quantities within a single molecule of a given chemical compound. However, it does not convey any details about the molecule's structure. It's important to note that compounds sharing the same molecular formula can exhibit distinct structures and properties. As a result, inputting a molecular formula in the search bar will generate a list of compounds that encompass the specified atoms and their respective quantities within each molecule.
