1. Login into your COCONUT account.

2. On the left pane, select "Molecules".

3. Inside the Molecules page, click on "New Molecule" button on the top right.

4. Fill the "Create Molecule" form:
    * Name - Chemical name of the compound
        * Ex: Betamethasone-17-valerate
    * Identifier - 
        * Ex: CNP0335993
    * Iupac name - The IUPAC name of a chemical compound is its name as determined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system of nomenclature. It provides a standardized and systematic way to name chemical substances so that each has a unique and universally accepted name. This system of naming helps in ensuring that chemists from around the world can clearly communicate and understand which chemical compound is being referred to.
        * Ex: [9-fluoro-11-hydroxy-17-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-10,13,16-trimethyl-3-oxo-6,7,8,11,12,14,15,16-octahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-yl] pentanoate
    * Standard inchi - Standard InChI (International Chemical Identifier): A textual representation of a chemical substance that encodes its structure in a standardized, machine-readable form. It is used to facilitate the exchange of information about chemical substances among databases and software. The InChI string is created using a defined algorithm, ensuring consistency and unambiguous identification of the substance.
        * Ex: InChI=1S/C27H37FO6/c1-5-6-7-23(33)34-27(22(32)15-29)16(2)12-20-19-9-8-17-13-18(30)10-11-24(17,3)26(19,28)21(31)14-25(20,27)4/h10-11,13,16,19-21,29,31H,5-9,12,14-15H2,1-4H3
    * Standard inchi key - A shorter, fixed-length (27 characters) version of the InChI, designed to be easier to use, search, and store. The InChI Key is a hashed representation of the InChI string, making it a convenient way to index and retrieve chemical substances in digital systems. It retains the essential structural information of the compound.
        * Ex: SNHRLVCMMWUAJD-UHFFFAOYSA-N
    * Canonical smiles - Canonical SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System): A notation that encodes the structure of a chemical molecule in a line of text using a series of characters. The canonical form of SMILES ensures a unique representation of the structure, which is useful for database searches and comparisons. SMILES notation captures the connectivity and chirality of the atoms in the molecule.
        * Ex: CCCCC(=O)OC1(C(=O)CO)C(C)CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC21C
    * Murko framework - A way of representing the core structure of a molecule by removing side chains and focusing on the central scaffold or framework. This method is often used in drug discovery to identify the core structures that are common to multiple biologically active compounds. The Murcko framework helps in understanding the basic structure-activity relationship (SAR) in medicinal chemistry.
    * Synonyms - Alternative names by which a chemical substance can be identified. These can include common names, trade names, abbreviations, or other nomenclature systems. Synonyms are important for cross-referencing and ensuring that a substance can be recognized under different names across various databases, publications, and industries.
        * Ex: Betamethasone 17 Valerate, SCHEMBL221479, .beta.-Methasone 17-valerate, SNHRLVCMMWUAJD-UHFFFAOYSA-N, STL451052, AKOS037482517, LS-15203, 9-Fluoro-11, 21-dihydroxy-16-methyl-3, 20-dioxopregna-1, 4-dien-17-yl pentanoate
